		<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>
			An egg muffin is a classic breakfast dish and is well accompanied by bacon.
			</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>12 slices bacon</li>
					<li>10 eggs</li>
					<li>¼ cup milk </li>
					<li>¼ cup chopped green onion </li>
					<li>¼ cup diced jalapeno pepper </li>
					<li>¼ cup diced roasted red pepper</li>
					<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
					<li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
					<li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare 12 muffin cups with cooking spray.</li>
					<li>Arrange bacon on a microwave-safe plate. Cook bacon in microwave for 75 seconds.</li>
					<li>Place a slice of bacon into each muffin cup so that the bacon lines the edges of the cup.</li>
					<li>Beat eggs and milk together in a bowl; ladle into muffin cups. Top 4 of the egg portions with 1 tablespoon each of the green onion, 4 with 1 tablespoon each jalapeno pepper, and 4 each with 1 tablespoon roasted red pepper.</li>
					<li>Bake in preheated oven until only slightly moist on top, about 20 minutes. Season the muffins with salt and pepper; top with Cheddar cheese. Continue baking until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes more.</li>
				</ol>
